Based off of a project in uni, I wanted to create a movie catalog web page using HTML and Java to manage my some of the movies I watched during this corona pandemic in 2020. Using aspects such as multi-threading, sockets and string manipulation, one can run the main file which is the "WebServer" java file which then gives further instructions how to use the program and interact with the database and website.
